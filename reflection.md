- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
So whatever encapsulation means, I don't get it and I don't have energy to search it up so I assume it affect my programming alot.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked? Nothing.
What didn't? This class.
Advice? You know that scene in Interstellar where Matthew McConaughey's character is yelling at his past daughter to not let him go on that horrible spacespice? This is my interstellar moment where I'm screaming at my past self that woke up at 7am to sign up for this class to just go back to sleep.
